# IBIO input-output helpers
## Simplified I/O in Java programs
   This repository contains a set of input-output helper functions written by the IBO.
## Usage
   1. Clone this repository into your project directory by running
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/jarmohurri/ibio.git
      ```
   2. If you want to use helper functions in a `.java`-file, add the following line into the file:
      ```
      import static ibio.Helpers.*;
      ```
   3. Now the helpers are available to you without a class prefix. For example, you can directly call
      ```
      output (156);
      ```
